# Variant-Call-Format-VCF-Data-Analysis

The **Variant Call Format (VCF) Data Analysis** is a Python mini-project focused on parsing and transforming variant call data from a VCF file. The VCF file contains information about genetic variants, including their chromosomal position, reference allele, alternate allele, and various predictor fields.

**Project Overview:**
The primary goal of this project is to develop Python functions that read, parse, and extract relevant data from the VCF file. The data extraction process involves selecting variants that have specific predictor fields with non-zero values. The selected variants are then transformed into dictionaries, and the final output is a list of these dictionaries.

**Functions Implemented:**
1. **pull_basic_and_predictor_fields:** This function reads the VCF file, selects variants that have at least one of the specified predictor fields (e.g., FATHMM_pred, LRT_pred), and extracts essential fields such as CHROM, POS, REF, ALT. It also converts text descriptions of predictor values to corresponding integer values and calculates the sum of these integers, storing it as "sum_predictor_values" in the dictionaries.

2. **pull_basic_and_predictor_fields_gzip:** This function performs the same operations as the previous function but specifically designed to process gzipped VCF files. It reads the gzipped file and parses it one line at a time, extracting the required information and storing it in dictionaries.

3. **return_all_non_zero_sum_predictor_values:** This function reads the output generated by the "pull_basic_and_predictor_fields_gzip" function (mini_project1_gzip.json). It then filters the variants and selects only those with non-zero "sum_predictor_values." The resulting filtered output is saved as "sum_predictor_values_gt_zero.json."

**Motivation:**
The project aims to teach learners how to handle and process large genomic data files like VCF efficiently. The step-by-step development of functions encourages breaking down a complex problem into manageable parts and demonstrates data manipulation techniques using Python.

**Usage:**
The project includes sample data files (mini_project_data.json and test_4families_annovar.vcf.gz) and test files (expected_mini_project1.json and expected_mini_project1_gzip.json). Users can run the provided functions on these data files and verify the outputs against the expected test files.

**Conclusion:**
The **Variant Call Format (VCF) Data Analysis** project offers practical hands-on experience in data parsing, transformation, and filtering using Python. By working with genomics data, learners can understand the complexities involved in real-world data analysis scenarios and apply Python programming skills to solve relevant challenges.

*Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and provides a basic implementation to parse and analyze VCF data. It is not designed to replace comprehensive bioinformatics tools used in genomic research.*
